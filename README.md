:bulb: # Idea Board :bulb:
[Live demo (Heroku)](https://shrouded-shelf-73200.herokuapp.com/)

Never lose an idea for a project ever again! Idea Board app helps you stay organized by tracking all your ideas in one spot. 

Note: This is a minimum viable product prototype for a larger application. This application was built using Node.js, Express, and MongDB. 

## Motivation

Build an easy-to-use and attractively designed app that demonstrates the following functionalities:

* Idea Board dashboard for quick view of all current ideas and projects
* Add new ideas 
* Track and edit existing ideas

In order to strengthen my core full-stack development capabilities I focused on the following skills:
* Test-driven development (TDD)
* Component-based web app design
* Server-side APIs providing full CRUD capabilities
